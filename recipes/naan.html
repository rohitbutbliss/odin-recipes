        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Naan (pronounced nahn) is an oven-baked, leavened bread that is stuffed and flavored in a variety of ways. An
            essential
            part of South and Central Asian cuisine, naan is easy, affordable, and makes the most of pantry ingredients
            you
            already
            have on hand.
        </p>

        <p>Flour, yeast, milk, and butter make a tender dough that's simply seasoned with garlic and salt, but there is
            a
            wide
            array of naan bread flavors. You'll find everything from coconut and raisin-stuffed bread to saucy
            lamb-topped
            naan in
            restaurants and home kitchens around the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1(0.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1
                    hour.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough
                    about the size of
                    a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a
                    towel, and allow to
                    rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many
                    as
                    you can fit) and
                    cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip,
                    and
                    cook until
                    browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy!
            </li>
